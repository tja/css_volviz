Volume Visualization with CSS3 3D Transforms
============================================

Introduction
------------
Sample code how CSS3 3D transforms can be used to implement volume visualization via the approach described in
the paper "Accelerated volume rendering and tomographic reconstruction using texture mapping hardware" by
Cabral et al. (1994). A good description can be found here:

---------------
See this blog post for details of the JavaScript/CSS3 implementation in the repository:

Datasets
--------
The repository contains two volumetric data sets:

 - Aneurism : Courtesy of Philips Research, Hamburg, Germany.
 - Engine : Courtesy of General Electric
 
Both datasets have been downloaded from the following data set archive:

   http://www.gris.uni-tuebingen.de/edu/areas/scivis/volren/datasets/datasets.html

I simply converted the datasets into PNGs with a fixed transfer function for this demo.
